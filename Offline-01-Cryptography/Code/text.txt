Dark urine is not always a sign of illness. Daily fluctuation in the color and character of urine is expected in healthy individuals.

When dark urine results from a medical condition, it is often seen in conjunction with other symptoms.

In the majority of cases where dark urine is a symptom of an underlying condition, dark urine is rarely the only condition present. It almost always occurs in conjunction with other symptoms related to the condition.

If dark urine is accompanied by certain symptoms (blood in the urine, straining to urinate), immediate medical attention should be sought to determine the cause. Unproductive attempts to urinate are always a medical emergency.
